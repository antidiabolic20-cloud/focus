# Feature Improvements for User Growth & Engagement

Here are several high-impact features designed to increase user acquisition ("trigger more users"), retention, and daily activity.

## 1. Viral & Social Triggers (Growth)
* **Referral System (XP Boosts)**:
    * **Idea**: "Invite a friend and you BOTH get 500 XP."
    * **Why**: Incentivizes users to bring their classmates.
* **Battle Tournaments**:
    * **Idea**: Weekly "Subject Showdowns" (e.g., "Friday Math Madness") with a unique badge for the winner.
    * **Why**: Creates "Appointment Dynamics" — users *must* log in at a specific time, creating buzz.
* **Shareable Achievements**:
    * **Idea**: When a user wins a battle or completes a challenge, generate a beautiful image card: "I just defeated @User in Physics! Can you beat me?"
    * **Why**: Free marketing on Instagram/Snapchat/WhatsApp.

## 2. Retention & Addiction (Stickiness)
* **Daily Streaks**:
    * **Idea**: A fire icon next to the profile showing consecutive days studied. "Don't break the chain!"
    * **Why**: Loss aversion is a powerful motivator.
* **Leagues & Divisions**:
    * **Idea**: Instead of one global leaderboard, place users in "Bronze", "Silver", "Gold" leagues. Bottom 10% get demoted, top 10% promoted weekly.
    * **Why**: Makes competition feel winnable and urgent.
* **XP Shop (Avatar Customization)**:
    * **Idea**: Use XP to buy cool profile frames, name colors, or unique avatars.
    * **Why**: Gives "value" to the XP, making users grind harder.

## 3. High-Value Utilities (Utility)
* **AI Flashcards (Spaced Repetition)**:
    * **Idea**: After taking a Mock Test, automatically generate flashcards for the questions the user got WRONG.
    * **Why**: Solves a real student pain point (revising mistakes) instantly.
* **Study Buddy Voice Rooms**:
    * **Idea**: Allow "Deep Focus" rooms where buddies can join a muted or distinct voice channel just to feel presence.
    * **Why**: Replicates the library experience.

## Recommended Phase 1 Plan (Low Effort, High Impact)
1.  **Streaks**: Easy to implement, huge retention value.
2.  **XP Shop**: Giving XP value makes the Battle Arena much more addictive.
3.  **Simple Referrals**: A unique invite link for each user.
